## Projects and Repositories
### ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84228144/185381557-a121ed11-2021-4fe7-ab8b-de2bb715732b.png)
I am going to create a repository for each project and tie them to one project. There is going to be a repository for project 2, 3, 4, and 5.

## Branching Strategy
The branching strategy that will be employed in each project is that I am gonna be working on the main branch on every project. If a bug arises, I will then create a develop branch to fix it.

## .gitignore Usage
In each project, the .gitignore will be used to hide some sensitive files from the public, even though the repositories themselves will  be public.

## Security
Credentials and sensitive information will be stored in files that will be ignored from being published to the public.
