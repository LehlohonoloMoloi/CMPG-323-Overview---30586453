## Projects and Repositories

I am going to create a repository for each project.

## Branching Strategy
The branching strategy that will be employed in each project is that I am gonna be working on the main branch on every project. If a bug arises, I will then create a development branch to fix it.

## .gitignore Usage
In each project, the .gitignore will be used to hide some sensitive files from the public, even though the repositories themselves will  be public.

## Security
Credentials and sensitive information will be stored in files that will be ignored from being published to the public.
